                    <h3 class="stickyTitle">Orchestra and Junior Orchestra</h3>
                    <p>Our orchestra is our defining feature. Once a week, players are greatly encouraged to meet up and play with our other sister instrument groups, Brass, Woodwind and Choir.</p>
                    <p>During this time musical and key skills are honed and developed.</p>
                    <p>We practice regularly as this music then comes together for periodic concerts and shows, every half year. Performing in public is necessary for any musician and players get this great opportunity to be noticed as well as provide for the public.</p>
                        
                    <p>Junior players are also offered the opportunity to perform with their age group. Working together is a core skill for any player and it is extremely likely during their musical lifetime players will have to play in a group and learn how the different groups and instruments work together.</p>
                    <p>This is also a great time to learn how to keep time and be directed by a conductor who will teach the students to work with each other and how by coming together different people and instruments can create something much greater than any individual sound.</p>
                    <p>Juniors also play shows and concerts as a starter to our main orchestra where appropriate.</p>
                        
                    <p>Although most usually performed in Bristol and the South West Allegro Symphony Orchestra often have the opportunity to perform not only in other parts of the UK but also abroad in Europe with different nationalities and environments.</p>

                    <h3 class="stickyTitle">String Quartets</h3>
                    <p>Allegro Symphony Strings Group originally starter out as a Strings Quarter when 4 new musicians met up to play together and started performing on the street for the public soon after,</p>
                    <p>As the group grew the 4 founders grew into a full orchestra by collaborating with others and started offering private lessons to help other players improve their skills.</p>
                    <p>However, they still played together once a week and we have kept this tradition alive.</p>
                    <p>Once a week a quartet of two Violins, a Viola and a Cello will meet up to train and perfect.</p>
                    <p>This is expected to be by themselves, however a conductor or teacher will often go to offer advice and help where they can.</p>
                    <p>The quartets will sometimes play in concerts or shows depending on demand and scheduling.</p>
                        
                    <p>Despite there being no official Junior Quartet, we have no age limits and have had a mix of ages play together and several juniors play together depending on the organiser.</p> 
                    <p>This is greatly encouraged, and help provided where it can.</p>

                    <h3 class="stickyTitle">Personal Lessons</h3>
                    <p>Every player needs to develop their musical skills. Learning never stops at any knowledge level or age.</p>
                    <p>From our most initial of beginners to the Section Leads, all must regularly practice and receive help and positive criticism from an external listener who can point out areas to improve in.</p>
                    <p>Players and teachers are matched up in with the same instruments to offer the most expert of advice, each teacher is expected to be able to accompany on the piano too.</p>
                    <p>This will develop time keeping skills and other instrument collaboration in new players and offer a stable accompaniment to professional players.</p>
                    <p>Personal lessons are offered at least once a week at a time and day that best suits the student, but students can privately communicate with their mentors to do more if possible. </p>
                    <p>Teachers and mentors are vetted for experience before beginning lessons, most of our teachers are the most experience players in our Orchestra and community who can help new players through the musical journey that they themselves have experienced.</p>
