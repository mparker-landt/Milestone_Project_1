With minor adjustments to some colours for personal preference.
#### Typography
Fonts for the website came from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).\
For the main body the general font Montserrat was used, a popular frontend font due to its readability and availability.\
For the Header title the stylised font Tangerine was used, this allowed for readability whilst given the impression of cursive writing for the classical impression.
